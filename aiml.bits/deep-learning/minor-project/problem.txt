Image Captioning - Using CNN + LSTM and CNN + GRU

Use the following dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k to an external site.
Tasks:

1. Load the dataset ( 1 Mark )

2. Display images and their captions  for only 5 images ( 2 Mark )

3. Split the dataset into train and test ( 1 Mark )

4. Perform the required preprocessing steps to train the model. ( 2 Marks )

5. Create a model-1 where CNN  would be used as a encoder followed by LSTM to generate the text. ( 4 Marks )

6. Create model -2 where CNN would be used as encoder followed by GRU to generate the text. ( 4 Marks )

7. plot the loss curve for both the models with epochs. ( 2 Marks )

8. Select the optimal evaluation matrix and compare the result for model - 1 and model - 2 , Jutify the reason why choose that evaluation matrix ( 2 Marks )

9. Comment on model performance (  1 Marks )

10. Print the true caption and predicted caption by model - 1 and model - 2  for only 5 images. ( 3 Marks ) 

Output should look like :

Display image
True / Original caption
Caption generated by model - 1
Caption generated by mode - 2
11. List down 4 applications of image captioning model in real world. ( 2 Marks )

Note: You are free to choose the model parameters  but make sure to use CNN , GRU and LSTM only.
