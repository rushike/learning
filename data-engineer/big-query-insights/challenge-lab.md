order by date
limit 1
;
```



Task 6. Finding days with zero net new cases
The following query is written to identify the number of days in India between 25, Feb 2020 and 13, March 2020 when there were zero increases in the number of confirmed cases. However it is not executing properly.

You need to update the query to complete it and obtain the result:

```sql

WITH india_cases_by_date AS (
  SELECT
    date,
    SUM(cumulative_confirmed) AS cases
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
  WHERE
    country_name="India"
    AND date between '2020-02-25' and '2020-03-11'
  GROUP BY
    date
  ORDER BY
    date ASC
 )
, india_previous_day_comparison AS
(SELECT
  date,
  cases,
  LAG(cases) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS previous_day,
  cases - LAG(cases) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS net_new_cases
FROM india_cases_by_date
)

select count(*) from india_previous_day_comparison
where net_new_cases = 0

```





Task 7. Doubling rate
Using the previous query as a template, write a query to find out the dates on which the confirmed cases increased by more than Limit Value% compared to the previous day (indicating doubling rate of ~ 7 days) in the US between the dates March 22, 2020 and April 20, 2020. The query needs to return the list of dates, the confirmed cases on that day, the confirmed cases the previous day, and the percentage increase in cases between the days.

Use the following names for the returned fields: Date, Confirmed_Cases_On_Day, Confirmed_Cases_Previous_Day and Percentage_Increase_In_Cases.



```sql
WITH us_cases_by_date AS (
  SELECT
    date,
    SUM( cumulative_confirmed ) AS cases
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
  WHERE
    country_name="United States of America"
    AND date between '2020-03-22' and '2020-04-20'
  GROUP BY
    date
  ORDER BY
    date ASC
 )

, us_previous_day_comparison AS
(SELECT
  date,
  cases,
  LAG(cases) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS previous_day,
  cases - LAG(cases) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS net_new_cases,
  (cases - LAG(cases) OVER(ORDER BY date))*100/LAG(cases) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS percentage_increase
FROM us_cases_by_date
)
SELECT
  Date,
  cases AS Confirmed_Cases_On_Day,
  previous_day AS Confirmed_Cases_Previous_Day,
  percentage_increase AS Percentage_Increase_In_Cases
FROM
  us_previous_day_comparison
WHERE
  percentage_increase > 5
```



Task 8. Recovery rate
Build a query to list the recovery rates of countries arranged in descending order (limit to 5) upto the date May 10, 2020.

Restrict the query to only those countries having more than 50K confirmed cases.

The query needs to return the following fields: country, recovered_cases, confirmed_cases, recovery_rate.
Columns to reference:

* country_name
* cumulative_confirmed
* cumulative_recovered

```sql
select 
  country_name as country,
  sum(cumulative_confirmed) confirmed_cases,
  sum(cumulative_recovered) as recovered_cases,
  sum(cumulative_recovered) * 100 / sum(cumulative_confirmed) as recovery_rate
from `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
where date = '2020-05-10'
group by country_name
having sum(cumulative_confirmed) >= 50000
order by recovery_rate desc
limit 5
;

```




Task 9. CDGR - Cumulative daily growth rate
The following query is trying to calculate the CDGR on April 10, 2020(Cumulative Daily Growth Rate) for France since the day the first case was reported.The first case was reported on Jan 24, 2020.

The CDGR is calculated as:

((last_day_cases/first_day_cases)^1/days_diff)-1)

Where :

last_day_cases is the number of confirmed cases on May 10, 2020

first_day_cases is the number of confirmed cases on Jan 24, 2020

days_diff is the number of days between Jan 24 - May 10, 2020

The query isnâ€™t executing properly. Can you fix the error to make the query execute successfully?

```sql
WITH
  france_cases AS (
  SELECT
    date,
    SUM(cumulative_confirmed) AS total_cases
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.covid19_open_data.covid19_open_data`
  WHERE
    country_name="France"
    AND date IN ('2020-01-24',
      '2020-04-10')
  GROUP BY
    date
  ORDER BY
    date)
, summary as (
SELECT
  total_cases AS first_day_cases,
  LEAD(total_cases) OVER(ORDER BY date) AS last_day_cases,
  DATE_DIFF(LEAD(date) OVER(ORDER BY date),date, day) AS days_diff
FROM
  france_cases
LIMIT 1
)

select first_day_cases, last_day_cases, days_diff, POWER(last_day_cases/first_day_cases,1/days_diff)-1 as cdgr
from summary

```
